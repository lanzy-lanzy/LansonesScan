# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Lansones Disease Scanner is a mobile application that enables users to detect and analyze diseases in both lansones fruit and leaves using AI-powered image analysis. The app will provide an intuitive interface for capturing or uploading images, analyzing them using Google's Gemini API, and maintaining a history of scans for reference. The application will be built using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for the UI and Room database for local storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer or fruit inspector, I want to navigate easily between different sections of the app, so that I can efficiently access all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a bottom navigation bar with four tabs: Dashboard, Analysis, History, and Settings
2. WHEN a user taps on any navigation tab THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding screen within 200ms
3. WHEN a user is on any screen THEN the system SHALL highlight the current active tab in the bottom navigation
4. WHEN the user navigates between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain the navigation state and prevent unnecessary recomposition

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an overview of my recent scans and app statistics on the dashboard, so that I can quickly understand my scanning activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the total number of scans performed
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show the most recent 5 scan results with thumbnails and disease status
3. WHEN there are no previous scans THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with guidance to start scanning
4. WHEN the user taps on a recent scan item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed scan result view
5. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display quick action buttons for starting a new analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to analyze lansones fruit and leaf images for disease detection using both camera capture and image upload, so that I can identify potential issues with my plants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the Analysis screen THEN the system SHALL display two options: "Take Photo" and "Upload Image"
2. WHEN the user selects "Take Photo" THEN the system SHALL open the device camera with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN the user captures a photo THEN the system SHALL display a preview with options to retake or proceed with analysis
4. WHEN the user selects "Upload Image" THEN the system SHALL open the device gallery for image selection
5. WHEN an image is selected or captured THEN the system SHALL validate that the image is in a supported format (JPEG, PNG)
6. WHEN the user confirms the image THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify whether they are analyzing fruit or leaves
7. WHEN the analysis type is selected THEN the system SHALL send the image to Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash model) with appropriate context for fruit or leaf analysis
8. WHEN the analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator with progress feedback
9. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display the results including disease detection status, confidence level, affected plant part (fruit/leaves), and specific recommendations
10. WHEN the analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with retry options
11. WHEN the analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically save the result to the local database with the analysis type (fruit/leaves)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my scan history with detailed results, so that I can track disease patterns and refer to previous analyses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the History screen THEN the system SHALL display all previous scans in chronological order (newest first)
2. WHEN the history loads THEN the system SHALL show each scan with thumbnail, date/time, analysis type (fruit/leaves), and disease status summary
3. WHEN there are many scans THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or lazy loading for performance
4. WHEN the user taps on a history item THEN the system SHALL display detailed scan results including full image, analysis results, and metadata
5. WHEN the user is viewing scan details THEN the system SHALL provide options to delete the scan or share the results
6. WHEN the user deletes a scan THEN the system SHALL remove it from both the database and display with confirmation
7. WHEN there is no scan history THEN the system SHALL display an empty state encouraging the user to start scanning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure app settings and manage my data, so that I can customize the app experience and maintain privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to Settings THEN the system SHALL display options for app configuration
2. WHEN the settings load THEN the system SHALL show options to clear scan history, manage storage, and configure analysis preferences
3. WHEN the user selects "Clear History" THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deleting all scan data
4. WHEN the user confirms history clearing THEN the system SHALL remove all scans from the database and update the UI
5. WHEN the settings display storage information THEN the system SHALL show current database size and number of stored images
6. WHEN the user accesses app information THEN the system SHALL display version number, developer information, and privacy policy links

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to store my scan images and results locally, so that I can access my data offline and maintain privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scan is completed THEN the system SHALL store the image file in the app's private storage
2. WHEN scan results are received THEN the system SHALL save the analysis data, metadata, and image reference in Room database
3. WHEN the app is offline THEN the system SHALL still allow users to view previously stored scan history
4. WHEN the database reaches storage limits THEN the system SHALL provide options to manage storage or clean old data
5. WHEN the app is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL ensure all stored data is properly removed from the device

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have an attractive and intuitive interface, so that I can easily use all features without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a modern, Material Design 3 compliant interface
2. WHEN users interact with any element THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback and animations
3. WHEN displaying scan results THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators for healthy vs diseased status for both fruit and leaves
4. WHEN the app is used in different lighting conditions THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes
5. WHEN users navigate through the app THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
6. WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL ensure proper aspect ratios and loading states
7. WHEN showing analysis results THEN the system SHALL use charts, progress indicators, or visual elements to make data easily understandable
