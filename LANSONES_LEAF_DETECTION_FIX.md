# Lansones Leaf Detection Fix

## Problem
The lansones leaf detection was not working properly. When users uploaded images of lansones leaves, the system failed to:
1. Properly identify the leaves as lansones
2. Detect diseases on the leaves

## Root Causes

### 1. Insufficient Detection Prompt
The original `DETECTION_PROMPT` had minimal information about lansones leaves:
- Only mentioned "compound, oval-shaped with prominent veins"
- Lacked detailed botanical characteristics
- Did not specify the compound pinnate structure with 5-7 leaflets

### 2. Weak Fallback Detection Logic
The fallback detection logic in `parseDetectionResponse()` defaulted to "lansones_fruit" when lansones was detected, never considering leaves.

### 3. Generic Leaf Analysis Prompt
The `LEAF_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` lacked specific details about lansones leaf structure and common diseases.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Detection Prompt
Added comprehensive botanical details for lansones leaves:
- **Compound pinnate structure**: 5-7 leaflets per leaf
- **Leaflet dimensions**: 9-21 cm long, 5-10 cm wide
- **Shape**: Oblong to elliptic
- **Surface characteristics**: Smooth, glossy, dark green on top
- **Arrangement**: Alternate or opposite along rachis
- **Margins**: Entire (smooth, not serrated)
- **New growth**: May have reddish or bronze tint

### 2. Improved Fallback Detection
Enhanced the text-based fallback detection to check for leaf-related keywords:
- "leaf", "leaves", "foliage", "leaflet"
- "compound", "pinnate"
- Properly sets `itemType` to "lansones_leaves" when detected

### 3. Comprehensive Leaf Analysis Prompt
Expanded the leaf analysis prompt with:

**Fungal Diseases:**
- Cercospora Leaf Spot (with specific symptoms)
- Phyllosticta Leaf Spot
- Powdery Mildew (Oidium lansium)
- Downy Mildew
- Anthracnose

**Bacterial Diseases:**
- Bacterial Leaf Blight
- Bacterial Leaf Spot

**Pest Damage:**
- Scale Insects
- Mealybugs
- Spider Mites
- Thrips
- Leaf Miners
- Caterpillars

**Nutrient Deficiencies:**
- Nitrogen, Potassium, Magnesium, Iron, Manganese deficiencies
- Specific symptoms for each

**Environmental Stress:**
- Sunburn, Wind Damage, Water Stress, Cold Damage

**Analysis Guidelines:**
- Detailed examination checklist
- Pattern recognition guidance
- Distribution assessment

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ Lansones leaves will be properly detected and identified
2. ✅ The system will correctly classify images as "lansones_leaves" type
3. ✅ Disease detection on leaves will be more accurate and specific
4. ✅ Users will receive detailed, actionable recommendations for leaf diseases
5. ✅ The AI will have better context to distinguish lansones leaves from other plants

## Testing Recommendations

Test the following scenarios:
1. Upload images of healthy lansones leaves
2. Upload images of diseased lansones leaves (various diseases)
3. Upload images showing nutrient deficiencies
4. Upload images with pest damage
5. Upload images of other plant leaves (should be classified as non-lansones)

## Files Modified

- `app/src/main/java/com/ml/lansonesscan/data/remote/service/AnalysisService.kt`
  - Enhanced `DETECTION_PROMPT` with detailed leaf characteristics
  - Improved `LEAF_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` with comprehensive disease information
  - Fixed `parseDetectionResponse()` fallback logic to properly detect leaves
